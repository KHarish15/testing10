# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

## Setting up GitHub Actions for KHarish15/testing10

This project uses HTML with Playwright for testing.  Since there's no JavaScript or external dependencies, the setup will focus on running Playwright tests against the HTML file.

**1. Adding the Workflow File**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repository.  This is the standard location for GitHub Actions workflows.  The workflow will run tests on push events.

```yaml
name: Run Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Playwright
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'  # Or a compatible version
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npm install playwright

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'  # Or a compatible version
          cache: 'npm'


        run: |
          npx playwright install
          npx playwright test
```

**2. Environment Variables (None Required)**

No environment variables are necessary for this basic setup.

**3. Dependencies (Installed by Playwright)**

Playwright is the only dependency and will be automatically installed.

**4. Configuring the Test Framework (Playwright)**

Playwright needs to be configured to interact with your HTML file.  This needs slightly more detail than provided.

a.  **Create a `playwright.config.js` file:**  In your project root, create a file named `playwright.config.js`.  This is where Playwright configuration is stored. Since you likely want to run tests against a local server, the config should look like this:

```javascript
const { defineConfig } = require('@playwright/test');

module.exports = defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  // other configurations for Playwright like reporter, browser options, etc.
});
```


b. **Create a `tests` directory**: Create a `tests` directory in the same level as your HTML file.  In this directory, create test files named `login_tests.spec.js` (or similar)



c. **Write your test cases**:  Within your `login_tests.spec.js` (or equivalent) file, use Playwright to test your HTML login functionality:

```javascript
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('Login with valid credentials', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to your login page (using localhost)
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/');


  // Fill the form and submit
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'john.doe@example.com');
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'P@ssw0rd123');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // Assertions to check if the login was successful (e.g., redirection).
  // Add assertions based on your expected login behavior.
});
```


**5. Viewing Test Results**

GitHub Actions will display the test results directly in the Actions tab of your repository.  Pass/fail status and detailed output will be visible.

**6. Troubleshooting Common Issues**

* **Node.js Version Issues:** Ensure that the `node-version` in the workflow matches a supported version of Node.js.
* **Playwright Installation Errors:** Double-check the npm install command in the workflow. Verify that you have the correct versions of playwright and other dependencies.
* **Browser Testing Issues:** If you encounter problems with browser tests, verify that the browser is properly installed and configured, and your tests target the correct HTML elements.
* **Locators:** Use appropriate selectors (e.g., `id`, `class`, `name`, CSS selectors) for your HTML elements to ensure correct interaction.

**7. Project-Specific Configuration Steps**

* **Local Server Setup**: Use a simple HTTP server (like `http-server`) to serve your HTML file locally.

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. This is where your Playwright tests will run.

* **HTML Validation**: Use tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service to validate the HTML for structural correctness.

* **Cross-browser Testing**: Playwright allows running tests on multiple browsers.  Use the `use` block in Playwright config to specify browser versions during test.

**Important Considerations**:

* Provide more specific details about the login form structure in your HTML. This will help with more precise Playwright tests.
* Clearly identify the elements in your HTML that should be targeted by Playwright selectors, such as `id` or `class` attributes of input fields and submit buttons.


These detailed instructions should allow you to effectively integrate GitHub Actions for testing your HTML login form using Playwright. Remember to adjust the paths and test cases to match your specific project structure.
